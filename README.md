# **üìä Project: Customer Segmentation & Revenue Analysis**

### In this SQL and Power BI project, I analyze customer segments, loyalty, purchasing behavior, and product performance to improve business strategies and enhance profitability. Below is an overview of the insights I gathered, explained in a way that's easy to follow.
#### Key Insights:
1. Total Revenue: $169.49M
2. Total Cost: $100.47M
3. Profit: $69.02M
4. Profit %: 68.69%
5. Profit Margin: 40.72%
6. Products Sold: 275K


## ***Customer Segmentation Analysis:***

### I used RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) segmentation to classify customers into groups based on their behavior. This helps businesses target marketing efforts more effectively. Here‚Äôs how the customer base breaks down:
#### ***Premium Customers:*** Customers who consistently make high-value purchases.
* Revenue: $89M
* Profit: $36M
#### ***Loyal Customers:*** Repeat customers who regularly buy products.
* Revenue: $37M
* Profit: $15M
#### ***Lost Customers:*** Customers who haven‚Äôt made a purchase recently.
* Revenue: $33M
* Profit: $13M
#### ***Regular Customers:*** Buyers with average spending.
* Revenue: $11M
* Profit: $5M
#### ***Low Customers:*** Repeat customers with very low spending
* Revenue: $41K
* Profit: $18K

## ***Customer Retention:***

### Customer retention is all about keeping customers coming back. It‚Äôs important because retaining a customer is often more cost-effective than acquiring a new one. I used retention rates to measure how many customers the business managed to keep over time. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:
* **Total Customers:** 19,119 (100%)
* **Repeat Customers:** 16,601 (86.83%) ‚Äì These are customers who have made multiple purchases over time. The higher the number of repeat customers, the healthier the business.
  1. Revenue $167.48M
  2. Profit $68.2M
* **Lost Customers:** 2,518 (13.17%) ‚Äì These customers have not made a purchase in a while, indicating they might not return.
  1. Revenue $2.02M
  2. Profit $0.82M

#### Understanding the balance between repeat and lost customers helps a business focus on re-engaging lost customers while rewarding loyal ones.

#### ***2012/2013 Customer Analysis:***
* Total Customers: 315
* 132 customers improved at 41.9% rate
* 183 customers declined at 58.1% rate
* Improved Customers: Spent $38M with +$7M difference
* Declined Customers: Spent $46M with -$12M difference

## ***Product Sales Insights:***

### ***Top Products:*** Identifying products that are frequently purchased together to drive cross-selling and upselling strategies.
* Example: The Mountain Bottle Cage and Water Bottle - 30 oz. are frequently bought together.
* Terry Eminhizer is our best customer in the last 6 months, based on purchased made of $264K, but we made the highest profit of 115.9K from Kathleen Garza in the last 6 months.

## ***Inventory Management:***

### ***Revenue and Product Sold by Product Category:***
* Bikes: $144.1M, 90K (The largest contributor to revenue)
* Components: $20.33M, 74K
* Clothing: $3.38M, 62K
* Accessories: $1.68M, 49K

### ***Popular Products Among High-Value Customers:***
#### High-value customers typically purchase the following items:
* AWC Logo Cap: 1,793 units sold
* Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey (L): 1,772 units sold
* Sport-100 Helmet: Over 1,000 units sold across different colors

## ***Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):***

### Customer Lifetime Value is the total amount of money a business can expect to earn from a customer throughout their relationship. CLV helps a company estimate long-term profitability from its customer base. CLV was calculated by analyzing how much customers spend on average and how long they stay active as buyers. Here are the insights from the data:
* ***Average Purchase Value: $1.40K ‚Äì*** This is the average amount each customer spends per transaction.
* ***Customer Value: $8.87K -*** This is the monetary value of an average customer
* ***Average Customer Lifespan: 0.46 Years -*** This is the period an average individual stays as customer 
* ***Customer Lifetime Value: $4.09K ‚Äì*** This is the projected revenue from a customer over the entire period they remain with the business.

#### A high CLV means that customers are likely to stay loyal, make repeat purchases, and generate more revenue over time. Businesses can use CLV to focus their marketing efforts on high-value customers who are likely to bring more profit in the future.

## ***Summary of Findings and Recommendations***

### **Summary of Findings:**

#### This project focuses on understanding customer behavior, revenue generation, and product performance using data analytics. The analysis was carried out using Power BI to visualize important business metrics, and here‚Äôs a summary of the key findings:

1. **Revenue and Profit Analysis:**

* The business generated a total revenue of $169.49M and a profit of $69.02M.
* The largest contributor to revenue was the Bikes category, which generated over $144M.
* Repeat Customers accounted for the majority of the revenue, contributing $167.48M out of the total.

2. **Customer Segmentation:** Using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, customers were divided into different segments based on their buying behavior:

* Premium Customers: Generated the highest revenue of $89M, showing that they are the most valuable customer group.
* Loyal Customers: Contributed significantly with $37M in revenue.
* Lost Customers: Represented customers who haven‚Äôt made purchases recently, with $33M in revenue.
* Regular Customers: Contributed $11M in revenue.

3. **Customer Retention:**

* 86.83% of the customers are repeat buyers, which indicates strong customer loyalty.
* However, 13.17% of customers have been lost, suggesting that retention efforts can be improved.

4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):**

* The average Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) was estimated to be $4.09K, which means that on average, each customer is expected to contribute over $4,000 in revenue over their relationship with the business.
* The average purchase value was $1.40K, with customers making around 6.35 purchases on average.

5. **Product Performance:**

* The Bikes category was the top performer in terms of both sales and revenue.
* Popular products among high-value customers include the AWC Logo Cap and Sport-100 Helmets, which were frequently purchased together with other accessories, indicating opportunities for cross-selling and upselling.

6. **Sales by Month and Year:**

* Sales performance showed fluctuations over time, with peak months and product categories contributing to seasonal demand.


### ***Recommendations:***

#### Based on the findings, here are some strategic recommendations to further enhance business performance:

1. **Focus on Premium and Loyal Customers:**
* Since Premium and Loyal Customers contribute the most to revenue, the business should focus on maintaining and growing these segments. Implementing loyalty programs and offering personalized deals can help retain these high-value customers.
2. **Improve Customer Retention Efforts:**
*With 13.17% of customers classified as ‚ÄúLost,‚Äù targeted marketing strategies such as re-engagement campaigns, discounts for inactive customers, or personalized communication can help bring these customers back. Leveraging customer data to understand why these customers stopped purchasing will help develop more effective retention strategies.
3. **Expand Cross-Selling and Upselling:**
* The data shows that products like helmets and water bottles are often purchased together, providing opportunities to bundle items and encourage customers to buy more during each transaction. This could boost both average purchase value and CLV.
4. **Optimize Product Inventory:**
* Ensure that popular items like the AWC Logo Cap and Sport-100 Helmets are always in stock to meet customer demand, especially among high-value customers. Monitoring stock levels and adjusting supply chain strategies can prevent stockouts and lost sales.
5. **Tailor Marketing by Segment:**
* Use the RFM segmentation insights to tailor marketing efforts. For example:
  1. Premium Customers: Offer exclusive deals, early access to new products, or premium service.
  2. Loyal Customers: Reward frequent buyers with loyalty points or discounts.
  3. Lost Customers: Send personalized re-engagement offers to incentivize a return.
6. **Enhance Data-Driven Decision-Making:**
* Continue leveraging data analytics to monitor performance across different customer segments and product lines. With tools like Power BI, regular updates on customer behavior and sales trends can help the business stay agile and responsive to market changes.

#### By focusing on these strategies, the business can improve customer retention, increase revenue, and make more data-driven decisions to ensure long-term growth and success.
